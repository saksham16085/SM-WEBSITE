      I am Saksham Vohra, i am a student of IIITD(Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology) in Computer Science stream.
      I am a kind of Person who likes CODING a lot and that is one of the reasons due to which I chose to take admission in a 
      college like IIITD, as I have heard from many people and have experienced myself in the past 3-4 months, that this 
      institute is quite different from other institutes.IIITD belives in really teaching their students, and make sure they 
      learn things by doing continous evaluations, not like other Colleges, where they just make students mug up things and 
      even if the students study at the very last moment, they are able to pass with FLYING COLOURS (not in IIITD :)  ).
      Also, i like playing football, I think it is a good form of excersise and it helps me relieve stress and makes my mind
      fresh.I also like writing poems, like he one on my website's <a href="index.html">Home page</a>.I have also started 
      writing some <a href="https://weeklyblogsweb.wordpress.com/">blogs</a> as a weekly activity for one of my courses in IIITD.
